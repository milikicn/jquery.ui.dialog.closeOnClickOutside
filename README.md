jQuery UI Dialog Close on Click Outside
=============================

This plugin extends basic jQuery UI Dialog by adding a new option **closeOnClickOutside** that controls whether dialog should be closed when clicking outside of it.

## How to use
In order to use this plugin, include file *jquery.ui.dialog.closeOnClickOutside.js* after a javascript include containing jQuery UI Dialog plugin. Usually, jQuery UI Dialog is included in the jQuery UI bundle.

Tested with jQuery v1.10.2 and jQuery UI 1.11.2, but it should work with other (relatively new versions).

## Example

Include in your HTML file after jQuery UI bundle:

```javascript 
...
<script src="/prosolo/resources/javascript/jquery-ui-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
<script src="/prosolo/resources/javascript/jquery.ui.dialog-clickoutside.js"></script>
...
```
